# TerraStation

The TerraStation provider is responsible for connecting your DApp with the most updated browser extension available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/terra-station-wallet/aiifbnbfobpmeekipheeijimdpnlpgpp).

When configuring the Shuttle package for TerraStation, set up the provider information as follows:

```ts
import { TerraStationProvider } from "@delphi-labs/shuttle";

const terraStationProvider = new TerraStationProvider({
  networks: [
    {
      name: "Terra 2",
      chainId: "phoenix-1",
      rpc: "<your-rpc-url-here>",
      rest: "https://phoenix-lcd.terra.dev/",
    },
    {
      name: "Terra 2 Testnet",
      chainId: "pisco-1",
      rpc: "<your-rpc-url-here>",
      rest: "https://pisco-lcd.terra.dev/",
    },
    {
      name: "Terra Classic",
      chainId: "columbus-5",
      rpc: "https://rpc-columbus.keplr.app",
      rest: "https://lcd-columbus.keplr.app",
    },
  ],
});
```

Note that when using TerraStation, it is possible to set up other networks beyond the default options. However, this must be done by the end user. To support different chains, you will need to educate your DApp users on the appropriate configuration/settings.
