# How can I connect to wallet providers?

When configuring wallet providers you can set a custom id or leave the default options in place. This also applies to configuration setting for specific app chains. Custom settings allow you to connect to a specific wallet provider and specific chain. Otherwise, you can use dynamic code like in the example on the previous page.

The following example uses hardcoded values so you can more easily see how it works:

```ts
import { useShuttle } from "@delphilabs/shuttle";

function App() {
  const { connect } = useShuttle();

  return <>
    <button
      onClick={() => connect('keplr', 'mars-1')}
    >
      Connect Keplr ({network.name})
    </button>
  </>
}
```

In the example above, the user will connect to Mars Hub (using the `mars-1` chain id) via Keplr (using the wallet provider id `keplr`).
