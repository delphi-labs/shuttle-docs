# How can I get the most recent wallet?

A core piece of logic of any DApp frontend is, knowing which wallet address is connected with it. Most DApps only need to know a single wallet that is connected to a single chain. That's why the following package exposes the most `recentWallet`.

```ts
import { useCosmosWallets } from "@delphilabs/cosmos-wallets";

function App() {
  const { recentWallet } = useCosmosWallets();
   
  return <>
    {recentWallet && (
      <>
        <h2>Recent Wallet</h2>
        <p>ID: {recentWallet.id}</p>
        <p>Provider ID: {recentWallet.providerId}</p>
        <p>Chain ID: {recentWallet.network.chainId}</p>
        <p>Address: {recentWallet.account.address}</p>
      </>
    )}
  </>
}
```
