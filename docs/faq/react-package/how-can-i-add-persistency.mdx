# How can I add persistency?

Persistent dApps connections work like regular application. Just as sessions can be remembered, so, too, can wallet connections.

The package comes with a built-in persistency feature. To enable it, do the following:

```ts
import { ShuttleProvider } from "@delphi-labs/shuttle";

function App() {
  return (
    <ShuttleProvider
      // Add the following prop if you want wallet connections
      // to be persisted to local storage.
      persistent
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ShuttleProvider>
  );
}
```
