# How can I add persistency?

Persistent DApps connections work like regular application. Just as sessions can be remembered, so, too, can wallet connections.

This package comes with a built-in persistency feature. To enable it, do the following:

```ts
import { CosmosWalletsContextProvider } from "@delphilabs/cosmos-wallets";

function App() {
  return <CosmosWalletsContextProvider
    // Add the following prop if you want wallet connections
    // to be persisted to local storage.
    persistent
  >
    <Component {...pageProps} />
  </CosmosWalletsContextProvider>
}
```
