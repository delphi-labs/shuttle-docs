# How can I add persistency?

Persistent dApps connections work like regular application. Just as sessions can be remembered, so, too, can wallet connections.

The package comes with a built-in persistency feature. To enable it, do the following:

```ts
import { ShuttleContextProvider } from "@delphilabs/shuttle";

function App() {
  return <ShuttleContextProvider
    // Add the following prop if you want wallet connections
    // to be persisted to local storage.
    persistent
  >
    <Component {...pageProps} />
  </ShuttleContextProvider>
}
```
