# How can I get all connected wallets?

Since the core thesis of this package is the ability to build a DApp that is multi wallet and multi chain, it was built to handle multiple wallet connections. You can easily view all connected wallets with the following code:

```ts
import { useCosmosWallets } from "@delphilabs/cosmos-wallets";

function App() {
  const { getWallets } = useCosmosWallets();
  
  return <>
    <h2>Connected Wallets</h2>
    {getWallets().map((wallet) => {
      return (
        <div key={wallet.id}>
          <p>ID: {wallet.id}</p>
          <p>Provider ID: {wallet.providerId}</p>
          <p>Chain ID: {wallet.network.chainId}</p>
          <p>Address: {wallet.account.address}</p>
          <hr />
        </div>
      );
    })}
  </>
}
```
