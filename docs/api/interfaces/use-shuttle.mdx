# useShuttle

The react hook, that is used to access shuttle's context provider state.

```tsx
import { useShuttle } from "@delphi-labs/shuttle";

function Header() {
  const {
    /* ... */
  } = useShuttle();

  return <>{/* ... */}</>;
}
```

The context state that is returned by `useShuttle` has the following structure.

```ts
type ShuttleContextType = {
  providers: WalletProvider[];
  mobileProviders: MobileWalletProvider[];
  mobileConnect: (options: {
    mobileProviderId: string;
    chainId: string;
    callback?: (walletConnection: WalletConnection) => void;
  }) => Promise<MobileConnectResponse>;
  connect: (options: {
    providerId: string;
    chainId: string;
  }) => Promise<WalletConnection>;
  wallets: WalletConnection[];
  getWallets: (filters?: {
    providerId?: string;
    chainId?: string;
  }) => WalletConnection[];
  recentWallet: WalletConnection | null;
  disconnect: (filters?: { providerId?: string; chainId?: string }) => void;
  disconnectWallet: (wallet: WalletConnection) => void;
  simulate: (options: {
    messages: TransactionMsg[];
    wallet?: WalletConnection | null;
  }) => Promise<SimulateResult>;
  broadcast: (options: {
    messages: TransactionMsg[];
    feeAmount?: string | null;
    gasLimit?: string | null;
    memo?: string | null;
    wallet?: WalletConnection | null;
    mobile?: boolean;
  }) => Promise<BroadcastResult>;
  sign: (options: {
    messages: TransactionMsg[];
    feeAmount?: string | null;
    gasLimit?: string | null;
    memo?: string | null;
    wallet?: WalletConnection | null;
