# EVM Chains

Shuttle currently only supports Injective, when setting your providers you can configure which networks are enabled for that specific provider by sending in a network object like the one bellow (example with Injective).

```ts
import {
  fromInjectiveEthereumChainToCosmosChain,
  Network,
} from "@delphi-labs/shuttle";
import { bech32 } from "bech32";
import { Address } from "ethereumjs-util";

const INJECTIVE_MAINNET: Network = {
  name: "Injective Mainnet",
  chainId: "injective-1",
  chainPrefix: "inj",
  rpc: "https://k8s.mainnet.tm.injective.network",
  rest: "https://k8s.mainnet.lcd.injective.network",
  defaultCurrency: {
    coinDenom: "INJ",
    coinMinimalDenom: "inj",
    coinDecimals: 18,
    coinGeckoId: "injective",
  },
  gasPrice: "0.0005inj",
  evm: {
    deriveCosmosAddress: (ethAddress: string): string => {
      const addressBuffer = Address.fromString(
        ethAddress.toString()
      ).toBuffer();

      return bech32.encode("inj", bech32.toWords(addressBuffer));
    },
    fromEthChainToCosmosChain: (chainId: number): string => {
      return fromInjectiveEthereumChainToCosmosChain(chainId);
    },
  },
};
```

As you can notice, evm chains require an extra configuration object `evm`, this is so that Shuttle can connect to Metamask and similar wallets.

For more information on all network configuration options, check this [page](../../api/type-definitions/network).
