# Introduction

> *Integrate the most popular Cosmos wallets into your multi-chain dApp with just a few lines of code using the open-source Shuttle package.*

As the Cosmoverse expands, so does the number of wallets and app chains in the ecosystem. With no standard for wallet interfaces, integrating specific wallets and app chains into your dApp’s frontend is time-consuming and laborious.

Shuttle package allows you to connect any combination of Cosmos wallets and app chains to your dApp’s frontend with just a few lines of code. Simple to integrate, the package abstracts away the logic of connecting to a particular wallet or app chain, and makes adding or removing support for various chains painless.

Initially developed by Delphi Labs, Shuttle is open-source software designed to turn wallet connections into a plug-and-play Lego™ brick for Cosmos dApps.
