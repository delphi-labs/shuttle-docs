# Introduction

As the Cosmoverse expands, so does the number of wallets and appchains in the ecosystem. With no standard for wallet interfaces, integrating specific wallets and appchains into your DApp’s frontend is time-consuming and laborious.

The Cosmos Wallets package allows you to connect any combination of Cosmos wallets and appchains to your DApp’s frontend with just a few lines of code. Simple to integrate, the package abstracts away the logic of connecting to a particular wallet or appchain, and makes adding or removing support for various chains painless.

Initially developed by Delphi Labs, Cosmos Wallets is open-source software designed to turn wallet connections into a plug-and-play Lego™ brick for front-end devs.
