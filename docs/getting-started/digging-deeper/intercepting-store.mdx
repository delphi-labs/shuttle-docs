# Intercepting the store

It is possible to pass in your own store to shuttle, it will still update it and needs to conform to the following `ShuttleStore` interface.

```tsx
import { ShuttleProvider } from "@delphi-labs/shuttle";

import CustomStore from "./store";

function App() {
  return (
    <ShuttleProvider
      // Add the following prop if you want shuttle
      // to use your own custom store.
      store={CustomStore}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ShuttleProvider>
  );
}
```
