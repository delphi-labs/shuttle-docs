# Connect to extension wallet

In order to connect to a wallet, we need to call `connect` from the `useShuttle` hook as follows:

```tsx
import { useShuttle } from "@delphi-labs/shuttle";

function Header() {
  const { connect } = useShuttle();

  const onConnect = () => {
    connect({ providerId: "keplr", chainId: "mars-1" });
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={onConnect}>Connect</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

The previous implementation is very naive and uses hardcoded values in the connect method, let's dynamically render all possible and available providers.

```tsx
import { useShuttle } from "@delphi-labs/shuttle";

function Header() {
  const { connect, providers } = useShuttle();

  return (
    <>
      {providers.map((provider) => {
        return (
          <button
            key={provider.id}
            onClick={() =>
              connect({
                providerId: provider.id,
                chainId: "mars-1",
              })
            }
            disabled={!provider.initialized}
          >
            {provider.name}
          </button>
        );
      })}
    </>
  );
}
```

We are still hardcoding the `chainId` we want to connect to, if your dApp is multi-chain we leave the approach you want to use to you. Just as a hint, the `provider` object has all the enabled networks if you access `provider.networks` you could iterate through them to display all possible provider and network combinations.
