# Disconnect from wallet

In order to disconnect from a specific wallet we need to call the `disconnectWallet` method.

```tsx
import { useShuttle } from "@delphi-labs/shuttle";

function Header() {
  const currentNetworkId = useNetworkStore((state) => state.currentNetworkId);
  const { /* ... */, getWallets, disconnectWallet } = useShuttle();
  const wallet = getWallets({ chainId: currentNetworkId })[0];

  return (
    <>
      {wallet && (
        <>
          <p>Address: {wallet.account.address}</p>
          <button onClick={() => disconnectWallet(wallet)}>Disconnect</button>
        </>
      )}

      {!wallet && (
        /* ... */
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

We could also use a more generic method, `disconnect` which if your dApp isn't multi chain makes it a lot simpler, it also allows you to pass in a filter object in case you want to disconnect all `chainId: "mars-1"` or `providerId: "keplr"` wallets.

```tsx
import { useShuttle } from "@delphi-labs/shuttle";

function Header() {
  const { /* ... */, recentWallet, disconnect } = useShuttle();

  return (
    <>
      {recentWallet && (
        <>
          <p>Address: {recentWallet.account.address}</p>
          <button onClick={() => disconnect()}>Disconnect</button>
        </>
      )}

      {/* ... */}
    </>
  );
}
```
