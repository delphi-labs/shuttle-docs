# Connect to mobile wallet

Connecting to a mobile wallet is a bit more complex than an extension wallet, since it can either be done in a desktop or mobile environment. In a desktop environment its common to use a qr code that the mobile app reads. In a mobile environment we want to redirect to the wallet mobile app.

For this reason shuttle exposes a different method, `mobileConnect` that matches the different flow in order to connect to mobile wallets.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import QRCode from "react-qr-code";
import { useShuttle } from "@delphi-labs/shuttle";

import { isAndroid, isIOS, isMobile } from "./utils/device";

function Header() {
  const { mobileProviders, mobileConnect } = useShuttle();
  const [walletconnectUrl, setWalletconnectUrl] = useState("");

  return (
    <>
      {mobileProviders.map((mobileProvider) => {
        return (
          <button
            key={mobileProvider.id}
            onClick={async () => {
              const urls = await mobileConnect({
                mobileProviderId: mobileProvider.id,
                chainId: "mars-1",
                callback: () => {
                  setWalletconnectUrl("");
                },
              });

              if (isMobile()) {
                if (isAndroid()) {
                  window.location.href = urls.androidUrl;
                } else if (isIOS()) {
                  window.location.href = urls.iosUrl;
                } else {
                  window.location.href = urls.androidUrl;
                }
              } else {
                setWalletconnectUrl(urls.walletconnectUrl);
              }
            }}
            disabled={!mobileProvider.initialized}
          >
            {mobileProvider.name}
          </button>
        );
      })}

      {walletconnectUrl && (
        <>
          <QRCode value={walletconnectUrl} />
        </>
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

We are hardcoding the `chainId` we want to connect to, if your dApp is multi-chain we leave the approach you want to use to you. Just as a hint, the `provider` object has all the enabled networks if you access `provider.networks` you could iterate through them to display all possible provider and network combinations.
