# NextJS

To setup you must wrap your NextJS app with the `ShuttleProvider` like so:

```tsx
import { ShuttleProvider } from "@delphi-labs/shuttle";

const providers = [
  // ...
];

const mobileProviders = [
  // ...
];

function App() {
  return (
    <ShuttleProvider
      providers={providers}
      mobileProviders={mobileProviders}
      // Add the following prop if you want wallet connections
      // to be persisted to local storage.
      persistent
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ShuttleProvider>
  );
}
```

Notice that the providers are defined outside the component to make sure those arrays are constant, this is a very important rule to follow.
